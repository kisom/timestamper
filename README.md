# timestamper

This is a stupid little tool that just reads text from the input, and
emits it to standard output.

## Building and installing

You need cabal and a Haskell compiler (e.g. GHC) installed. Then,
clone this into some directory, `cd` into it, and run

```
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install
```

## Usage

Pipe stuff into it. Watch it spit out timestamped lines. Be amazed.

## License

See the LICENSE file.
